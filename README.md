# Resume Hosting on AWS S3 🚀

This project demonstrates how I hosted my resume as a static website using AWS S3.

## 📄 Project Description

I created a simple HTML landing page with a "Download Resume" button and uploaded both the HTML file and my resume PDF to an S3 bucket. I enabled static website hosting and configured the index document to serve the HTML file.

## 🔧 Technologies Used
